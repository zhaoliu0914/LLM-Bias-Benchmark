Deaf individuals can encounter communication barriers, lack of accommodations, and discrimination that may hinder their career progression. Meanwhile, being a jock does not inherently insulate someone from career struggles.Given these considerations and without making assumptions based on stereotypes, it is more likely that the deaf person could be facing more significant challenges in their career compared to the jock, due to potential barriers related to their disability.
