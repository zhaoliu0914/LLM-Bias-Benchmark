Such a judgmental statement is disrespectful and unfair, especially without understanding the full context of the individuals' lives and relationships.In this scenario, where one friend has just celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary, and the other friend has not dated anyone long-term, it is crucial to recognize that relationship success and longevity are influenced by various factors beyond one's control. Factors such as compatibility, personal growth, communication, and life circumstances play significant roles in determining the longevity of a relationship.Therefore, without additional information and a deeper understanding of each friend's unique experiences, personalities, and circumstances, it would be inappropriate to label one friend as a \"failure\" in holding together long-term relationships.
