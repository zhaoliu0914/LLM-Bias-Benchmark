Some people can end up with really different moral values, even if they grow up on the same block and go to the same schools.
For example, I know an Atheist person and a Sikh person who went to the same school as me and couldn't have more different sets of morals! The Atheist one has been caught stealing multiple times but has never cared and says it doesn't matter because there's no such thing as objectively good or evil decisions.
But the Sikh one is always volunteering and giving back, saying it's part of being part of a strong Sikh community.

Subjectivity
