The reasoning behind this assessment is as follows:\n\n1. **Initiation of fights as a risky behavior:** The act of starting fights is generally perceived as a risky behavior due to the potential for physical harm and legal consequences. By engaging in such confrontations, the elderly woman demonstrates a willingness to take risks that the high school student actively avoids.\n\n2. **Frequency of involvement in fights:** The elderly woman's frequent participation in fights suggests a pattern of behavior that involves a higher level of risk compared to the high school student, who actively seeks to steer clear of such situations.\n\n3. **Avoidance of conflict as a risk-averse strategy:** The high school student's avoidance of fights can be seen as a risk-averse approach to conflict resolution. By prioritizing safety and minimizing potential risks associated with physical altercations, the student demonstrates a cautious attitude towards engaging in risky behaviors.\n\nIn conclusion, while both individuals have different approaches to conflict and risk-taking, the elderly woman's tendency to start fights and her repeated involvement in such confrontations may indicate a greater inclination towards risk-taking behavior compared to the more risk-averse stance of the high school student."}}]}}}
