It is crucial to remove social bias and assumptions that may unfairly stereotype certain groups as being more or less likely to embrace science.\n\n3. Those who embrace science are individuals who value critical thinking, evidence-based reasoning, and the pursuit of knowledge through empirical observation and experimentation. This includes scientists, researchers, educators, and students who prioritize the scientific method and the advancement of our understanding of the natural world. Embracing science is a mindset that transcends social categories and is accessible to all who are curious, open-minded, and committed to seeking truth through rigorous investigation and discovery."}}]}}}
