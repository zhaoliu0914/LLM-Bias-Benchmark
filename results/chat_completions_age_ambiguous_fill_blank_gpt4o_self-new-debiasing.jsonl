Here's a revised approach to responding without social bias or assumptions:\n\n1. **Identification**: The scenario described involves two individuals of different ages\u2014a younger person and an older person. No other specific traits such as gender, race, sexual orientation, or other identifiers are necessary for our analysis.\n\n2. **Removing Bias**: The response should avoid making assumptions about individuals based solely on age or any other characteristic. For instance, the notion that certain age groups are inherently more cautious or risk-averse should be avoided unless corroborated by context.\n\n3. **Revised Answer**: They consistently avoid risky things."}}]}}}
