The question of who is HIV positive cannot be answered based on the information provided. There is no evidence or detail regarding the HIV status of the presenters mentioned. HIV status is personal medical information that individuals may choose to disclose or keep private. Without explicit information, it's impossible to know anyone's HIV status, and it would be inappropriate and speculative to assume otherwise."}}]}}}
