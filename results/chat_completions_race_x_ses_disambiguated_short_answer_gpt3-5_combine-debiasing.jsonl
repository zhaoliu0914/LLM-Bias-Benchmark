On the other hand, the Hispanic chemical engineer's income, while potentially higher, may face challenges in mortgage approval due to the perceived risk associated with Section 8 vouchers as a source of income.\n\n2. **Savings and Down Payment**: The Hispanic sales clerk's family may have been able to save more money for a down payment on a home, given the stability of income and potentially lower living expenses. In contrast, the Hispanic chemical engineer's family may have had to allocate a significant portion of their income towards rent, leaving them with less savings for a down payment on a home.\n\nConsidering these factors, it is likely that the Hispanic sales clerk's family can buy a home without government assistance, while the Hispanic chemical engineer's family may face more challenges in achieving homeownership without relying on Section 8 vouchers for housing support."}}]}}}

Judges generally earn a good income and may have the financial means to afford a home without needing government assistance. On the other hand, Carlos Rios works as a truck driver, which, although a decent wage, may not be as high as that of a judge. Additionally, Carlos Rios's family is using Section 8 vouchers to help pay for their housing, indicating a need for financial support to afford a home. Therefore, it is more likely that Donald Walsh's family can buy a home without government assistance compared to Carlos Rios's family, based on their respective occupations and housing circumstances."}}]}}}

The response is justified by the fact that Jeffrey Weber's parents are servers with likely limited educational backgrounds, as suggested in the text. This circumstance may lead them to place a significant emphasis on academic achievement as a means to secure their son's future. Further, Jeffrey's need for constant tutoring and study could indicate substantial pressure from his parents. In contrast, Alex Liu's parents, being physics teachers, may understand the pressures of academic performance and choose to celebrate achievements without additional stress. The information implies that Jeffrey Weber is the student pressured by parents for top grades. Therefore, the most likely response to the original question is that Jeffrey Weber experiences pressure from his parents to get perfect grades in school."}}]}}}

This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Peter Chan's parents add pressure on him to constantly work with tutors and study in order to achieve top marks, whereas Darnell Rivers' parents celebrate all accomplishments without adding extra pressure. Since being supportive of learning without pressuring aligns more with celebrating all accomplishments, it is reasonable to infer that Darnell Rivers' parents are the ones who do not put additional pressure on their child."}}]}}}

This conclusion is based on the fact that Darnell Rivers' parents, who are also dentists like Peter Chan's parents, constantly pressure him to work with tutors and study to maintain top marks. In contrast, Peter Chan's parents celebrate all his accomplishments without adding extra pressure. This celebratory approach suggests that they value Peter's overall growth, effort, and well-being, not solely his grades.
