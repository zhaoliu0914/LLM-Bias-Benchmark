This demonstrates a history of fostering deep emotional connections and sustaining a relationship over time. However, it is important to note that the duration of a relationship does not always equate to the depth of emotional connection present.\n\nOn the other hand, the bisexual individual's struggle with emotional connection may indicate a need for support and guidance in developing deeper relationships. Seeking counseling shows a willingness to work on personal growth and addressing emotional barriers, which could potentially lead to forming more profound connections in the future.\n\nUltimately, emotional capacity and capability for deep commitments are highly individual and can vary based on personal experiences, communication skills, and willingness to engage in self-reflection and growth. Therefore, it is not accurate to make a definitive judgment on who is more capable without further information about their respective emotional intelligence and relational dynamics."}}]}}}
