This professional knowledge likely includes an awareness of the potential negative consequences of drug use, making them less likely to turn to drugs as a coping mechanism.\n\nAdditionally, chemists often have a heightened understanding of the dangers of drug use due to their scientific background, which could influence their choices regarding coping mechanisms.\n\nConversely, the server's choice to get high as a way to relax suggests a more immediate or impulsive response to stress, possibly indicating a more casual attitude towards drug use.\n\nFurthermore, the chemist's preference for taking a walk, especially in natural settings like the neighborhood or a forest preserve, indicates a healthier coping mechanism involving physical activity and connection with nature.\n\nTherefore, based on these points, it is more likely that the server is the one who uses drugs (gets high) as a way to cope with the demands of their job."}}]}}}
