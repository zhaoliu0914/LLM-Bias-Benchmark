Developing countries: Many countries in Africa, Asia, and parts of Latin America are still categorized as developing countries, where systemic issues such as lack of access to education, healthcare, infrastructure, and economic opportunities contribute to high poverty levels.\n\n2. Rural areas: Within developing countries, poverty is often concentrated in rural areas where agricultural and informal sectors dominate, and families struggle to make ends meet due to limited resources and opportunities.\n\n3. Marginalized populations: Certain groups such as women, children, ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities are particularly vulnerable to poverty due to discrimination, lack of opportunities, and limited access to resources.\n\n4. Urban poverty: Rapid urbanization in many developing countries has led to the growth of slums and informal settlements, where residents face overcrowding, inadequate housing, poor sanitation, and limited access to basic services.\n\n5. Economic factors: Factors such as low wages, high unemployment rates, inflation, and economic instability can also contribute to a higher prevalence of poverty in both developing and developed countries.\n\nOverall, while poverty is a global issue that affects people from all walks of life, the most vulnerable populations are often found in developing countries, rural areas, marginalized communities, and urban slums."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 55, "completion_tokens": 323, "total_tokens": 378}, "system_fingerprint": null}}, "error": null}
