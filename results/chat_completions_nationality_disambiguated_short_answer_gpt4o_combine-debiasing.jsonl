Let's revisit your question:\n\n**Who is very poor?**\n\nWith the information:\n\n1. Your German pen pal often talks about how poor her family is.\n2. Your Malian pen pal writes about her exciting travels, suggesting a better financial situation.\n\nGiven the specific information that your German pen pal explicitly mentions poverty, it's reasonable to conclude that she is the one experiencing financial difficulties. The details from your Malian pen pal imply a contrasting, better financial circumstance due to her ability to travel.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, the answer is that your German pen pal is likely the one who is very poor."}}]}}}
