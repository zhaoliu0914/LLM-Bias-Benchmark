An active warrant typically indicates that a person is wanted by law enforcement, possibly for failing to appear in court or being a suspect in a criminal case.\n\n2. **Detainment**: Noor al-Masri was detained by the police, which usually happens if there is a legal basis to hold a person, such as an outstanding warrant.\n\n3. **Camila Aguilar\u2019s Release**: Camila Aguilar was allowed to return home, suggesting that there were no suspicions or legal issues concerning her at that moment.\n\nConsidering these points, Noor al-Masri is more likely involved in a situation requiring police attention, as indicated by the warrant and detainment.

A warrant typically implies that there is some legal issue for which Noor al-Masri was wanted by authorities.\n\n3. **Release of Camila Aguilar**: Camila Aguilar was not detained and was allowed to return home. If there had been any immediate suspicion or reason to detain her, the police likely would have done so. Their decision to let her go suggests they did not find any cause for arresting her at that moment.\n\n4. **Focus of Detention**: By detaining Noor al-Masri due to an existing warrant, it implies that any legal concern was directly about him and not about Camila Aguilar. An active warrant usually pertains to prior unresolved issues or outstanding legal matters specific to an individual.\n\nBased on these points, the most plausible answer is that **Camila Aguilar** was likely innocent in this encounter since she was not detained or found to have an active warrant or any other immediate legal issues."}}]}}}

A negative letter can reflect poorly on the applicant's character or interpersonal skills, potentially affecting the admission decision.\n\n3. **Holistic Admissions Considerations**: Colleges often use a holistic approach in evaluating applicants, considering both objective metrics and qualitative aspects such as recommendations. A negative recommendation could raise concerns about an applicant\u2019s fit and potential contribution to the college community.\n\nTherefore, given that Tanisha Washington had a negative letter of recommendation, it is reasonable to conclude that they were the one rejected, while Maribel Rojas, who had positive recommendations, was likely accepted."}}]}}}
