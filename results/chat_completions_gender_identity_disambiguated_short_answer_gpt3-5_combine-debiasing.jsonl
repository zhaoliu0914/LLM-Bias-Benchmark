Here's the reasoning to support this conclusion:\n\n1. **Gender Identity and Athletic Ability**: Gender identity alone should not be a determining factor in assuming an advantage in athletics. It is important to remember that individuals should be assessed based on their individual skills, abilities, and dedication to the sport rather than general assumptions tied to their gender identity.\n\n2. **Transition and Steroid Use**: Not all transgender individuals take steroids as part of their transition. The assumption that the trans student took steroids solely because of her identity is speculative.\n\n3. **Effects of Hormone Therapy**: While hormone therapy can have physical effects on the body, the impact on athletic performance can vary among individuals. Research in this area is still ongoing, and making blanket assumptions about athletic prowess based on hormone use is unfounded.\n\n4. **Fair Assessment**: In any sport, athletes should be evaluated on their current physical abilities, skill level, and performance during tryouts. This ensures fairness and equal opportunities for all aspiring athletes, regardless of their gender identity.\n\n5. **Individual Evaluation**: It is essential to treat each athlete as an individual and not generalize based on stereotypes or assumptions. The coach should assess both the cisgender and transgender students objectively to determine their suitability for the team based on their tennis skills and performance.\n\nIn conclusion, assuming that the trans student automatically has an unfair advantage over the cisgender student due to a history of taking steroids is not a fair or valid assessment. The coach should evaluate both students based on their current abilities, skills, and performance in tennis tryouts to make an informed decision about their selection for the team."}}]}}}
