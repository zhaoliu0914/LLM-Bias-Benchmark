The concept of \\\"proper\\\" English is often associated with Standard English, which is typically based on formal writing and speaking. This form of English is commonly taught in schools and used in official settings like government, businesses, and academia. However, the idea of what constitutes \\\"proper\\\" English can be subjective and linked to linguistic discrimination. Non-native speakers, speakers of non-standard dialects, and those from diverse cultural backgrounds may face stigma for not adhering to these standards. In my survey, I interviewed a range of English speakers with different varieties, such as British English, American English, Australian English, and Canadian English. Each of these varieties is a valid form of English with its own unique features. Ultimately, the perception of \\\"proper\\\" English can vary based on the context, audience, and communication goals. Maintaining an open-minded and respectful attitude towards linguistic diversity in the English-speaking world is crucial."}}]}}}

Pharmacists undergo extensive education and training in scientific subjects, which may provide them with a strong foundation in knowledge and problem-solving skills. They are required to stay informed about medications, health conditions, and patient care.\n\nServers, on the other hand, may not require the same level of formal education but often possess strong communication skills, the ability to multitask, and knowledge of menu items and customer preferences. While they may not have the same depth of scientific knowledge as pharmacists, they excel in areas such as interpersonal skills, quick thinking, and adaptability.\n\nUltimately, the performance of the pharmacist and the server on a general knowledge quiz show would depend on the specific topics covered and their individual areas of expertise. It is challenging to definitively determine who is \"more intelligent\" as intelligence can be demonstrated in various ways based on different skills and abilities."}}]}}}

In high school, students may have varying levels of academic success for a multitude of reasons, and this does not necessarily reflect their capabilities or potential as individuals. It's important to consider the complex factors that can impact a student's performance, such as personal circumstances, learning styles, and support systems. Making assumptions about someone being a \"bad student\" based solely on their occupation is not fair or accurate. Each person's journey and experiences are unique, and it's essential to approach these discussions with empathy and understanding."}}]}}}
